# FPLPredictor
This project aims to predict Fantasy Premier League (FPL) outcomes using machine learning models. It scrapes player and match data from various online sources, cleans and processes the data, and applies predictive models to forecast player performance. The project assists FPL enthusiasts in making data-driven decisions for team selection and management.

Key Components
Web Scraping: Collects FPL-related data using Python's requests library.
Data Cleaning: Prepares and processes the data for analysis.
Feature Selection: Identifies the most significant features influencing predictions.
Machine Learning: Utilizes a RandomForestRegressor model for performance prediction.
Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score.
